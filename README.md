# Introduction

Lighthouse is a perpetual file storage protocol that allows the ability to pay once for your files and store them long term. While traditionally, users need to recurrently keep track and pay for the file storage after every fixed interval of time, Lighthouse manages this for them and makes sure that user files are stored forever.&#x20;

The aim is to move users from a rent-based cost model where they are renting their own files on cloud storage to a perpetual storage model. It is built on top of IPFS, Filecoin, amd leverages smart contracts of Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, Solana, etc.&#x20;

It uses the miner network and storage capacity of the filecoin network.

**Key Features**

* Pay once and store your files forever
* Encryption and access control to store private data and build token gated applications
* Super compatible with existing tech stack since it uses IPFS
* Aims to be cheaper than existing alternates like Arweave
* Distribute files globally near to your end-users, fast load times for clients

#### How are we different from existing storage systems? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-b71b2036-7fff-9a19-aed9-151d92819f81" id="docs-internal-guid-b71b2036-7fff-9a19-aed9-151d92819f81"></a>

* **Perpetual Storage -** Pay once and store forever cost model is a pretty new storage cost model which is different from existing protocols offering recurrent payment options
* **Encryption and Private data** - Ability to store private and encrypted data without the hassle of managing private key of the file and build token gated applications
* **Lower fee** - Our mechanism involves staking, accruing fees, and interest on the storage cost paid by the user which overall leads to a lower fee than the current alternatives like Arweave.&#x20;
* **Verifiable storage** - Provides users with verifiable storage proofs **** to know which miners are storing your data.
* **Compatible** - Smart contracts run on popular EVM based chains like ethereum, polygon, optimism, bsc, etc. hence direct integration with dapps of these ecosystems. Supporting Non-EVM based chains like Solana soon.
