# Introduction

Lighthouse is a permanent decentralized file storage protocol that allows the ability to pay once and store forever. While traditionally, users need to repeatedly keep track and pay for their storage after every fixed amount of time, Lighthouse manages this for them and makes sure that user files are stored forever. The aim is to move users from a rent-based cost model where they are renting their own files on cloud storage to a permanent ownership model. It is built on top of IPFS, Filecoin, and Polygon. It uses the existing miner network and storage capacity of the filecoin network.

**Key Features**

* Pay once and store your files forever&#x20;
* Super compatible with existing tech stack since it uses IPFS&#x20;
* Cheaper than existing alternates like Arweave&#x20;
* Distribute files globally near to your end-users, fast load times&#x20;



#### How are we different from existing storage systems? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-b71b2036-7fff-9a19-aed9-151d92819f81" id="docs-internal-guid-b71b2036-7fff-9a19-aed9-151d92819f81"></a>

* Pay once and store forever cost model is a pretty new storage cost model which is different from existing protocols&#x20;
* Our mechanism involves staking, accruing fees, and interest on the storage cost paid by the user which overall leads to a lower fee than the current alternative like Arweave.&#x20;
* Smart contracts run on popular chains like polygon, Ethereum, etc. hence direct integration with existing dapps of these ecosystems
* IPFS and Filecoin are popular blockchain storage protocols and hence Lighthouse will be very compatible with the existing stack for projects to migrate to
