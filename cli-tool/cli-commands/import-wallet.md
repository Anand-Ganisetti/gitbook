To import wallet using the **private key**, use the following command

```
lighthouse-web3 import-wallet --key <private_key>
```



You can also import a previously created wallet by copying the private\_key from the wallet.json file&#x20;

```
{
    "privateKey": "<private_key>",
    "publicKey": "<public_key>"
}
```
