# upload

This is the command that is used to upload (store) a directory or file to the Lighthouse protocol

```
lighthouse-web3 upload <path>
```

The path can be a path to both a directory and a file. NodeJS 16 is the minimum version needed to upload the directory.

Note: Windows users should use WSL.
