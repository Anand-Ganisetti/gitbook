# create-wallet

Creates a new wallet.

```
lighthouse-web3 create-wallet
```

The above command prompts for a password before creating a wallet. A new wallet is created and wallet keys are stored in the same directory in the _wallet.json_ file.&#x20;

The user can send tokens (USDC, USDT, DAI or Polygon/ETH) to this wallet's public address for file payment.&#x20;
