2. [Upload Text/JSON with encryption](text-json.md)



**Kavach** is the Encryption SDK created by the Lighthouse team that allows you to build your trustless, decentralized, and fault-tolerant Applications using distributed key shards with threshold cryptography.

{% hint style="success" %}
Lighthouse SDK already uses the Kavach Encryption SDK underneath, so developers can directly refer to encryption and access control code examples to store private data on IPFS and build token-gated applications.

* Shard Key support for privateKey and other security keys
* Key Reconstruction from shards
* Fully typed, support in TypeScript
