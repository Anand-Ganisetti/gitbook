# Overview

Note: Lighthouse SDK already uses the Kavach Encryption SDK, so developers can directly refer to encryption and access control [code examples](../javascript/code-examples/) to store private data on IPFS and build token-gated applications.

**Kavach** is the Encryption SDK created by the Lighthouse team that allows you to build your trustless, decentralized, and fault-tolerant Applications using distributed key shards with threshold cryptography.

### Features

* Randomized key shard generation
* Shard Key support for privateKey and other security keys
* Key Reconstruction from shards
* Fully typed, support in TypeScript
* Stores shards on Lighthouse Encryption Key storage(Optional 5 nodes)
